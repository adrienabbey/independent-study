# Independent Study
- My BSCS degree requires 2 more credit hours of CS/CEG 4000-level courses
- Independent Study will allow me to get these two credit hours studying something I've been meaning to pursue for some time.
- Studying Kubernetes is my preference, but Rust is an alternative I'd also like to pursue.

# Kubernetes
## Pre-req: Containerization
- Create containers to my specifications (Docker)
- Automate building and distribution of those containers
## Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster
- 3x Raspberry Pi 4 8GB (already owned)
- Ubuntu Server 24.04
- MicroK8s (Kubernetes)
## Documentation
- Create documentation that could be used to teach others
- Helps reinforce what I'm learning
## Final Demonstration
- Create containers based on my current VM stack
- Use Kubernetes to effectively orchestrate the containers across my cluster

# Rust
## Learn
- Learn to write basic applications in Rust, then more
- Learn about the strengths of Rust vs. other languages
- Learn to use Rust libraries, proper implementation
	- This is something I still haven't learned to do with languages like Java (outside standard libraries)
	- Includes directory structure best practices
## Document
- Write a Rust 'Cook Book' of useful code snippets for personal use
## Demonstrate
- Basic console application with user input
- GUI application
- Multithreaded application leaning on memory safety
