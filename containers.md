# Containers

## Learning Goals

### Phase 1

Learn how to properly and effectively use Docker to self-host MediaWiki:

- Create separate containers for each service: one to host the database (MariaDB) and another to host Apache/PHP.
- Create a network to allow the containers to communicate with each other.
- Create persistent storage to save the database and MediaWiki files.
- How to properly handle secrets (passwords) to limit exposure of sensitive information.

### Phase 2

Advanced features I may not immediately benefit from:

- Self-hosting a container repository
- Automatic updates and deployment of containers
- Additional best-practices as discovered while learning.
